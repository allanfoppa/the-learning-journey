### June

> [!NOTE]
> Automating deployment and ensuring code quality with modern DevOps practices.

**Focus:** CI/CD & DevOps Fundamentals

**Key Topics/Languages:**  
    GitHub Actions (or Jenkins CI)  
    Automated Testing in pipelines  
    Environment management (dev, staging, prod)  
    Code quality checks (linting, formatting)  
    Deployment strategies (basic)  

**Some Goals:**  
	Create workflow files (.github/workflows/*.yml) (push, pull request, scheduled)  
	Define jobs and steps for build/test/deploy  
	Use marketplace actions (checkout, setup-node, etc.)  
	View logs and debug failed pipelines  
	Run unit tests automatically on every commit  
	Generate test coverage reports  
	Run ESLint/Prettier in pipeline before tests  
	Fail builds on linting errors  
	Optional: SonarQube or similar tools for code analysis  
	Manual deployment triggers vs automatic  
	Deploy on specific branch (e.g., main → production)  
	Blue-green deployment concept (zero downtime)  
	Rollback strategies if deployment fails  
	Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, Railway, AWS, DigitalOcean)  
	Health checks after deployment
